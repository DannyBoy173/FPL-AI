"""the team candidates generator script will take as input a combined file of all the retrieved data for each position and each of the predictions
made by the models. It will then remove all the non returners and handle any possible doubles or triples.

In order to create the input file, simply combine the retrieved data files, and append to it each of the predictions made by the models, you
should then remove the unnecessary columns and have only name, position, predicted and prediction.

The outputted file will be the team candidates which can be used by the team selector."""
